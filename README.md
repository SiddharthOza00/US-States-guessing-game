# US-States-guessing-game 

Remember in Friends when Chandler said you cannot name all the states in under 6 mins?


Well here's your chance to prove him wrong? Maybe?


Don't worry this time you'll have a helping hand.

When you run the code you will see a map of America and a dialog box will appear where you will enter the name of a state.

If you guessed correctly then the you will see the name of the state on it's location on the map.

You can see the screenshots of the output in the folder __Screenshot__.



**#Requirements-to-run-the-code**

1)You will need python 3.9 or higher interpreter to run the code

2)The code is written in PyCharm



#Hint...

You can write __"exit"__ in the dialog box to exit from the game.
You can see the remaining states to remember in the csv file named states_to_remember.csv

**But don't cheat!**
